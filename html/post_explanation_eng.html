<h2>Why Shark-King?</h2>
A <b>phishing website</b> imitates a trusted website, to attack the user (e.g. by stealing passwords). Our goal is to protect you from such attacks, which harm millions of users. 
<br><br>
<b>Shark-King: no more phishing!</b>
<br><br>
By installing the Shark-King browser add-on, you will participate in our experiment of anti-phishing defenses, and <b>protect yourself from phishing</b>. 
<br><br><b>How does it work?</b>
<br>Shark-King allows you to easily report suspect websites. To train you, Shark-King will (rarely) present fake versions of familiar websites. 
<br>Don't worry! Shark-King's fake sites will not harm you in any way, even if you fail to notice them. We protect your privacy carefully, as approved by the Bar-Ilan University Ethics Review Board.
<br>Shark-King will not capture or save any personal information.
<br><br>
</div>
<div id="image_button_feedback" style="display:none;">
Shark-King awards you points when you succeed in detecting fake sites. View your current points and ranking in the bottom part of the Shark-King menu:

<br><b>Don't get phished â€“ become a Shark-King!</b>

<div id="control" style="display:none;">
<h2>Training Phase</h2>
Now that you have completed the first phishing test, click on the "Phishing Game" button in order to be forwarded to a game that will help you learn more about protection against phishing. After completing the game, you will take a second and final phishing test, after which you will be able to start browsing as you like.
<br><br>

<div id="image_button" style="display:none;">
Shark-King maintains a <b>list of Suspected Sites</b>, to which you can add any site that you think is suspect.
<br>Shark-king also maintains a <b>list of Trusted Sites</b>, which Shark-King protects with a more secure login process, as follows:
</div>
<div id="image" style="display:none;">
<h2>Safe Login Process</h2>
You will soon be asked to select a unique image. Then, when you log into a <b>trusted site</b>, Shark-King will display this image, along with three other images. <br>Click on <b>your unique image</b> to login!
<br><br>
<img style="height:80%;width:80%;" src="../images/image_protection.gif">
<br><br>This simple step will help you identify most phishing attacks. If you reach a trusted site's login page, without passing through the image selection process, you should mark the site as suspect!
<br><br>
Please select a unique image that will be used from now on to identify you in the secure login process for Trusted Sites. You have two options:
<ul>
	<li>Upload 4 personal images, selecting one to be your unique image</li>
	<li>Select an image from the following standard images</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
If you choose to upload 4 personal images (only .jpg files accepted), do so here (remember - your unique image will be the one uploaded under "Unique"):
<br><br>
<form id="imageform" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
	<div class="labeldiv">
		Unique:
    	<input name="correct" id="correct" type="file" />
	</div>
	<div class="labeldiv">
		3 more images:
		<input name="other1" id="other1" type="file"/>
		<input name="other2" id="other2" type="file"/>
		<input name="other3" id="other3" type="file"/>
	</div>
    <br>
    <input name="sendbutton" value="Upload" type="submit" />
</form>
<div class="main" id="images">
<br><br>If you decide not to upload personal images, please select one of the following images as your unique image:
	<div class="table">
		<div class="cell">
		 	<div class="item">
			    <img>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<br><br>
</div>
<div id="image_after_selection" style="display:none;">
<h2>Training Phase</h2>
Now that you have selected your unique image, you will go through a short training phase, using the secure process described above. 
<br>We will now display 6 webpages, one after the other. If you notice the secure process (i.e. where you must choose the correct image out of the 4 images), you can mark the webpage as "Trusted". <br>Otherwise, mark the webpage as "Suspect". <br>To begin, click the "Start Training Phase" button.
<br><br>
</div>
<div id="button" style="display:none;">
<h2>Safe Login Process</h2>
<b>Always click on Shark-King's icon</b> <img style="height:2%;width:2%;" src="../icons/icon19.png"> in order to log into a trusted site. 
<br>This simple step will help you (and Shark-King) notice and foil most phishing attacks. 
<br>Never enter sensitive information into a trusted site, before clicking on Shark-King's icon and seeing the safe login message!
<br><br>

<h2>Training Phase</h2>
Now that you have completed the first phishing test, you will now go through a short training phase, using the secure process described above. 
<br>We will now display 6 webpages, one after the other. If you notice the secure process, you can mark the webpage as "Trusted", otherwise, mark the webpage as "Suspect". <br>To begin, click the "Start Training Phase" button.
<br><br>
</div>
<div id="feedback" style="display:none;">
Whenever a phishing experiment is launched, you are expected to identify some type of security problem, and immediately report it by clicking "Mark site as Suspect" on the Shark-King menu:
<br><br>
<img  style="height:25%;width:25%;" src="../images/mark_as_suspect.png">
<br><br>When you identify a security problem correctly, you will be notified by Shark-King. If you did not identify the security problem, you will be notified as well, so you can learn to be more cautious next time. 
<br><br>
<h2>Training Phase</h2>
Now that you have completed the first phishing test, you will now go through a short training phase, in which the add-on will provide feedback for your choices, as described above. 
<br>We will now display 6 webpages, one after the other. You should mark each site as "Trusted" or "Suspect", and read the feedback provided to you. To begin, click the "Start Training Phase" button.
