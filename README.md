# shark_king_chrome_add-on

Chrome add-on which used for my Master's thesis project. 
The add-on trains the user against phishing and spear-phishing attacks by applying those attacks on him randomly.

This project includes only the infrastructure for the add-on automatic training.

This project does not include the following files:
---------------------------------------------------
1. Server config files
2. Phishing websites list
3. Scripts used for applying the attacks
